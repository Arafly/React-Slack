# React-Slack

The app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

This is a simple Slack-like clone built with React and Pusher-Chatkit. Chatkit does most of the heavy lifting on the server end.
This mini chat has  the following features. But requires additional ones
 - Is typing indicator
  - Who's online
  - Group chat

## Installation

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ git clone 
$ cd 
$ yarn && yarn start
$ serve 
```

**The last command is to enable you serve the app on a local network with your friends. So they also can sign-in and chat in realtime!**
 
The app starts in development mode and opens a browser window on http://localhost:3300.


P.S    You might want to install serve globally to enjoy that feature
```sh
$ npm i -g serve 
```
